description: In 1809, New Yorkers were buzzing about a series of classified ads concerning
  the whereabouts of Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker. They were unaware that
  Washington Irving had invented the man entirely and placed the ads himself. Knickerbocker's
  purported manuscript, A History of New York, was Irving's own. Told from Knickerbocker's
  point of view, A History of New York is a chronicle of New York's fifty years under
  Dutch rule in the 1600s that plays fast and loose with the facts, to uproarious
  effect. A History of New York propelled Irving to the heights of literary stardom.
